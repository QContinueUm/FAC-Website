<p>Notes: 1) I learned everything covered in freecodecamp's basic HTML from having a Livejournal, which was like Facebook for people with attention spans and an even higher flair for drama. 2) I prefer using the h3 tag for my subtitles because the h2 default font/style is too overbearing for my tastes. 3) When I put the DOCTYPE tag at top, it doesn't show in github's preview viewer but does show up on the final published page.</p>
