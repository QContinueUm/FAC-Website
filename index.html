                <h2>who i am</h2>
                right. so, hello! i'm nico, which you know already.<br>
                i'm an immigrant here, from America. (she/they, by the way.)<br>
                my mum was an immigrant to America, from Colombia.<br>
                and my partner is an immigrant to the UK, from Turkey.
                <p>i guess you could say that immigration runs in my family<br>
                  and is a core part of my identity and values (immigration rights!)
                <p>i'm latinx, queer, neurodivergent, and a lifelong learner.<br>
                  i've had the privilege of a long career working with<br>
                   non-profits engaged in social justice work and in independent<br>
                   film (but not often enough simultaneously).<br>
                  <p>i come from privilege and am committed to the dismantling of systemic racism.<br>
                    i believe antiracism is not something you are but something you do.<br>
                    <p>i value the communal experience and seek out communities centered<br>
                    around inclusivity and diversity. i believe humans are at their best<br>
                    when they come together and collaboratively approach problems.
                    <p>every role i've had has called me to be a consummate problem-solver.<br>
                      tech can be prohibitiely inaccessible to non-profit organizations;<br>
                      i'm drawn to and motivated by the idea of bridging that gap.
                      <p>

                          and to the friend housing us while we're "between homes."

                <h2>why i'm applying</h2>
              i heard about founders and coders in 2016, around the time I moved<br>
              to the UK. i'd been interested in learning to code since 2004, something<br>
              i was introduced to while interning for a website called Boston.com. i was<br>
              a content producer and i worked closely with the in-house dev team. at that<br>
              time, it wasn't meant to be. i moved on to administrative work, and eventually<br>
              social justice work, but all the while the interest remained and often grew to<br>
              fever pitch, particularly when i would be looking for a tech solution that didn't<br>
              yet exist.<p>
              in non-profit work you are called to wear many hats with limited resources. this<br>
              always put me into the position of problem-solver and i always looked to tech solutions<br>
              to support the work i, and my team, did. bootcamps always intrigued me, but the cost was<br>
              always prohibitively expensive. solo learning was something i dabbled with, but without<br>
              peers and structure to keep me to task and to collaborate with, it was something that i<br>
              had difficulty finding the time and committment for.<p>
              upon learning about the peer-led model that founders and coders uses, my interest was<br>
              piqued. the program's core values align with my own: the value of community, comfort with<br>
              uncertainty, and a focus on helping others/group collaboration. the organization's commitment<br>
              to inclusivity, diversity, and good allyship all deeply resonate with other kinds of work i've<br>
              been engaged in, and work that i want to continue to engage in.
              <p>i am curious, open, eager to collaborate with and learn from others. a coding skillset would<br>
                open a lot of doors for me, as someone who has continuously hit the glass ceiling in all my<br>
                endeavors. i want to be part of a dynamic environment that's dedicated to group progress over<br>
                the individual; founders and coders seems to me a vision of how the tech industry could be,<br>
                a vision of the kind of tech industry i want to be part of.

                <h2>what i want to do</h2>
              <br>as mentioned in my intro section, i have worked with non-profits<br>
                  for the entirety of my working life. i worked as a program associate<br>
                  for a fund that supports grassroots organizations in India centered around<br>
                  union organizing, women's rights, trans rights, indigenous rights, and<br>
                  rights groups centered around caste-based discrimination. i have also <br>
                  worked in independent film for nearly as long.
                  <p>i'd love to support work in these areas, whether by working on tech<br>
                    that makes the lives of on-the-ground organizers easier, or improves<br>
                    access to resources (be it data sharing, statistics, or training others).
                    <p>i'm interested in contributing to Code for Social Good, Catch a Fire,<br>
                      and/or similar organizations. Organizations centered around prison reform,<br>
                      activism, immigration rights, and teaching girls to code all resonate too.<br>
                      as someone invested in visual storytelling, the possibilities of putting<br>
                      coding skills to work in game development (for example <a href="https://wearechicagogame.com/" target="_blank">We Are Chicago</a>)<br>
                      feel further afield but of no lesser interest too.
