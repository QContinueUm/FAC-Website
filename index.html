                <h2>who i am</h2>
                right. so, hello! i'm nico, which you know already.<br>
                i'm an immigrant here, from America. (she/they, by the way.)<br>
                my mum was an immigrant to America, from Colombia.<br>
                and my partner is an immigrant to the UK, from Turkey.
                <p>i guess you could say that immigration runs in my family<br>
                  and is a core part of my identity and values (immigration rights!)
                <p>i'm latinx, queer, neurodivergent, and a lifelong learner.<br>
                  i've had the privilege of a long career working with<br>
                   non-profits engaged in social justice work and in independent<br>
                   film (but not often enough simultaneously).<br>
                  <p>i come from privilege and am committed to the dismantling of systemic racism.<br>
                    i believe antiracism is not something you are but something you do.<br>
                    <p>i value the communal experience and seek out communities centered<br>
                    around inclusivity and diversity. i believe humans are at their best<br>
                    when they come together and collaboratively approach problems.
                    <p>every role i've had has called me to be a consummate problem-solver.<br>
                      tech can be prohibitiely inaccessible to non-profit organizations;<br>
                      i'm drawn to and motivated by the idea of bridging that gap.
                      <p>

                          i'd like to give special thanks to my partner who's taken on the<br>
                          the bulk of our shared duties while i've prepared this application,<br>
                          and to the friend housing us while we're "between homes."

                <h2>what i want to do</h2>
              <br>as mentioned in my intro section, i have worked with non-profits<br>
                  for the entirety of my working life. i worked as a program associate<br>
                  for a fund that supports grassroots organizations in India centered around<br>
                  union organizing, women's rights, trans rights, indigenous rights, and<br>
                  rights groups centered around caste-based discrimination. i have also <br>
                  worked in independent film for nearly as long.
                  <p>i'd love to support work in these areas, whether by working on tech<br>
                    that makes the lives of on-the-ground organizers easier, or improves<br>
                    access to resources (be it data sharing, statistics, or training others).
                    <p>i'm interested in contributing to Code for Social Good, Catch a Fire,<br>
                      and/or similar organizations. Organizations centered around prison reform,<br>
                      activism, immigration rights, and teaching girls to code all resonate too.<br>
                      as someone invested in visual storytelling, the possibilities of putting<br>
                      coding skills to work in game development (for example <a href="https://wearechicagogame.com/" target="_blank">We Are Chicago</a>)<br>
                      feel further afield but of no lesser interest too.
